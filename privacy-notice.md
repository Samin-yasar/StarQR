## SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS

**What personal information do we process?** StarQR processes no personal information, as all data is stored locally in your browser and not transmitted to any server. The application handles only QR code and barcode scan results, displayed in the "Last Scan Result" section and stored in the "Scan History" with potential metadata (e.g., scan type or timestamp). The "Statistics" section may include aggregated scan data, also stored locally. Personal information, such as names or email addresses, is not collected unless embedded in scanned codes, in which case it is only displayed and stored locally without further processing or transmission.

**Do we process any sensitive personal information?** StarQR does not process sensitive personal information unless it is embedded in scanned QR codes or barcodes (e.g., payment details or identifiers). Such data is decoded and stored locally in your browser without further processing or transmission, adhering to our zero-knowledge principle.

**Do we collect any information from third parties?** We do not collect any information from third parties.

**How do we process your information?** All processing occurs within your browser. StarQR decodes QR codes and barcodes from camera scans or uploaded images, displaying results in the "Last Scan Result" section and storing them locally in the "Scan History" with potential metadata. No data is transmitted externally.

**In what situations and with which parties do we share personal information?** StarQR does not share personal information with any third parties, as all data remains local to your device, ensuring privacy and security.

**How do we keep your information safe?** By processing and storing all data locally within your browser, StarQR prevents unauthorized access. Data, including scan results and history, is protected by your device’s and browser’s security features, such as encryption and access controls, with no external transmission.

**What are your rights?** As StarQR does not collect or share personal information, traditional data protection rights (e.g., access, rectification, deletion) are not applicable in the conventional sense. You retain full control over your data by managing scan results and history through the application’s interface (e.g., export, import, or clear history) and your browser’s local storage settings.

**How do you exercise your rights?** You exercise control over your data directly through StarQR’s interface by managing scan results and history or by clearing your browser’s local storage, ensuring complete autonomy in line with our zero-knowledge principle.

## 1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

### Personal Information You Disclose to Us

**In Short:** StarQR does not collect personal information, as all data is processed and stored locally within your browser.

StarQR does not collect personal information, as it operates exclusively within your browser without transmitting data to external servers. The application processes only data encoded in QR codes or barcodes that you voluntarily scan using your device’s camera or upload as images. This data is displayed in the "Last Scan Result" section and stored locally in the "Scan History" with potential metadata, such as scan type or timestamp, as facilitated by filtering, export, and import functionalities. Aggregated data may be presented in the "Statistics" section, also stored locally. As no personal information is collected, there is no requirement to provide true, complete, or accurate personal information or to notify us of changes.

### Sensitive Information

StarQR does not process sensitive information unless embedded in scanned QR codes or barcodes (e.g., financial details or identifiers). In such cases, the application decodes and stores this data locally within your browser without further processing or transmission, adhering to its zero-knowledge principle.

## 2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?

**In Short:** StarQR processes all data locally within your browser to provide QR and barcode scanning services, with no external transmission.

StarQR processes information exclusively within your browser, decoding data from QR codes or barcodes scanned via your device’s camera or uploaded images. This data is displayed in the "Last Scan Result" section and stored locally in the "Scan History" with potential metadata (e.g., scan type or timestamp). The "Statistics" section may present aggregated data, also stored locally. No data is transmitted to external servers, ensuring alignment with our zero-knowledge architecture.

## 3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?

**In Short:** As StarQR does not collect or process personal information in the traditional sense, legal bases such as consent or legal obligations are not applicable.

Given StarQR’s zero-knowledge architecture, no personal information is collected, processed, or transmitted, rendering traditional legal bases for processing personal data (e.g., consent, legal obligations, or vital interests under GDPR, UK GDPR, or Canadian law) inapplicable. The application processes only QR code or barcode data locally within your browser, and no user consent is required, as no data leaves your device.

## 4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

**In Short:** StarQR does not share personal information with any third parties, as all data remains local to your device.

StarQR does not share any data, including scan results or history, with third parties under any circumstances. All processing and storage occur locally within your browser, ensuring no data is transmitted externally, even in scenarios such as business transfers, in accordance with our zero-knowledge principle.

## 5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?

**In Short:** StarQR retains data only as long as it remains in your browser’s local storage, under your control.

StarQR stores scan results, history, and associated metadata locally in your browser’s storage, where it remains until you choose to clear it using the "Clear All History" feature or your browser’s storage settings. No data is retained on external servers, and retention is entirely at your discretion.

## 6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?

**In Short:** StarQR ensures data safety by processing and storing all information locally within your browser.

You may also access aggregated data in the "Statistics" section and manage all data via your browser’s local storage settings, ensuring full autonomy.

## 8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES

StarQR does not respond to Do-Not-Track (DNT) signals, as it does not track, monitor, or collect user data. No cookies, web beacons, or analytics are used, ensuring no online behavior is monitored.
